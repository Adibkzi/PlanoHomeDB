This folder is dedicated to display my advanced SQL knowledge.

You will find 3 items:
 
  - (1) The SQL code creating the tables and inserting values into those tables
  - (2) The SQL code that displays storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases.
  - (3) The SQL Code that displays advance queries (CTE, Temp Tables, varaibles, UDF, Stored Procedures)
